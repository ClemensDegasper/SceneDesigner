# SceneDesigner
This was my Bachelor Thesis. A 2D Scene designer for SPH software.
One can draw simple scenes and get rendered particles as json output.

It was a helper programm for the <a href="https://www.uibk.ac.at/umwelttechnik/research/projects/shpase.html.en">SPHase</a> project of the University Innsbruck.
